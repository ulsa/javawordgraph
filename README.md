This program, wordgraph, will read a text file, count word occurrences and produce
a histogram of the results.

Check out this lab from github.com:

	git clone git@github.com:ulsa/javawordgraph.git

The lab is constructed using [maven-lab-plugin](https://github.com/jayway/maven-lab-plugin). Initialize the lab to step 0 by running:

	mvn lab:init

Move to the next step when you have fixed the problems, compiled the code and ran
the tests. You can also skip to the next step if you give up and want to see a
solution to this step, and take on the next.

When you are ready for the next step, do this:

	mvn lab:next

Show the current step:

	mvn lab:currentStep

Restore all files that were affected by the lab:

	mvn lab:reset

To change to a particular step of the lab:

	mvn lab:setStep -DlabStep=nnn
